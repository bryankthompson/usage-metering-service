# Billing: price table and rating

Money is an integer count of micro-USD (1 USD = 1,000,000). No float and no true division in the money path.

## Prices
- `price_versions` holds, per model, numbered versions (1, 2, ...) with an `effective_from` and two integer
  prices: micro-USD per 1,000 input tokens and per 1,000 output tokens.
- `add_price_version` always adds the next version. A stored version is never changed or removed: a database
  trigger rejects UPDATE and DELETE.
- `price_at(model, at)` returns the version with the greatest `effective_from <= at` (a tie goes to the later
  version). No version in force raises `NoPrice`; a missing price is never rated as zero.

## Rating
`rate` = `(tokens_in * input_price + tokens_out * output_price)` divided by 1,000 in integer arithmetic, rounded
half up ONCE on that sum. Example: 1 token at 1,500 micros per 1k is 1.5, which becomes 2.

## Charges
`GET /v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/charges?start=...&end=...` (timezone-aware datetimes) rates the tenant's
`usage_rollups_hourly` rows with `start <= hour_start < end`. Each row is rated at its own `hour_start`, so a price
change mid-period applies from its effective time. Each row is rounded on its own; `total_micros` is the sum of lines.
Status codes: 403 if the caller's tenant is not the path tenant, 422 for naive datetimes or `start >= end`,
409 if a row has no price in force (the response names the model).

## Tests
`DATABASE_URL=... uv run pytest -q tests/test_pricing.py tests/test_pricing_charges.py` (needs Postgres, see `compose.yaml`).

## Not done
No admin API: prices are added through `add_price_version`. Nothing is sent to Stripe and no invoice is made.
